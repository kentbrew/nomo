Nomo
====

A Chrome extension that hides the Moments tab in Twitter

#### How do I install Nomo?

- Open up Chrome's extension page by typing `chrome://extensions` into your URL bar.

- Be sure the checkbox next to "Developer mode" is checked! (thanks, @soypunk!)

- Use the Download ZIP button on this page to get the archive.

- Unzip this archive. You should have one folder, probably named `nomo-master`.

- Drag the folder into the extensions page until you see the Drop to Install note.

- Drop it.

#### How can I tell if it's working?

Log in on Twitter and see if your Moments tab disappears.
